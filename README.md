# CShell

## Description
CShell is a custom UNIX shell implementation written in C. It offers a lightweight command line interface for UNIX users and supports functionalities such as command execution, basic input/output redirection, and pipes, as well as signal handling. The project is organized into two main components:
- `input_parser.c/h`: Contains functions for parsing user input into tokens, executing commands, and freeing allocated memory.
- `shell.c`: The core shell file which integrates all functionalities and handles user interactions.

## Key Features
- **Command Execution**: Execute standard UNIX commands.
- **Input/Output Redirection**: Redirect command input and output using `<` and `>`.
- **Pipes**: Supports basic two-stage pipelines to chain commands.
- **Signal Handling**: Manages UNIX signals gracefully within the shell environment.

## Planned Features
- **Advanced Pipeline Handling**: Enhance the current pipeline feature to support complex multi-stage command pipelines.
- **Change Directories**: Implement functionality to change current working directories within the shell.
- **Command History**: Introduce a history feature allowing users to view up to the last 500 commands entered.
